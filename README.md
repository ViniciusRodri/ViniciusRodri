### Hi there 👋
### Hello, my name is Vinicius Rodrigues! 👋

I live in brazil, i'm finishing college of Computer Engineering. I fell in love and joined and I've been training in the front-end area since 2019.

I've always loved technology, and what made me fall in love with the front end was the ability to create new things every day, whether it's solving problems or creating pages.
